# Sarsoft / SARTopo GPS Client

Garmin is no longer supporting their web browser plug-in.  This project is a
client-side tool designed to run in the web browser and can be dropped into
Sarsoft/SARTopo to make it easier to import data from a GPS unit.  The main
intent is to import data for SAR purposes.
